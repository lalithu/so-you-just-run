Welcome to soyoujustrun, where I delve into the exhilarating world of running and uncover the fascinating realm of applied physics!

Animations and scientific visuals improve conceptual understanding by showing dynamic processes and relationships, making learning clearer and more interactive when compared to trying to learn from a set of static images. I primarily utilize Python to create dynamic visualizations that simplify complex scientific and mathematical concepts, making them more accessible and easier to understand. With the help of libraries such as `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, and others, I bring abstract ideas to life with engaging, interactive graphics.

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Lalith Uriti, an undergraduate of mechanical engineering at the Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. My passion for engineering stems from a deep desire to comprehend the mechanisms that drive our world and an insatiable curiosity for uncovering the science and physics behind them. </p>
    <p>I love running, development, listening to music, and learning new things.</p>
    <p>My marathon <a href="https://www.sportstimingsolutions.in/share.php?event_id=78282&bib=9513">PR (Personal Record)</a> as of May 30th, 2024 is <code>04:05:47</code> which I set at the 2024 TATA Mumbai Marathon in January. I'm currently training for my next event, the 2024 Bengaluru Marathon by Wipro typically held during the first weekend of October.</p>

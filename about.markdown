# About Me

Hi, I'm Lalith Uriti, an undergraduate of mechanical engineering at the Manipal Institute of Technology. My journey in engineering is fueled by a passion for understanding the mechanics that drive our world and a curiosity for uncovering the science behind everyday phenomena.

# My Interests

I love running, development, listening to music, and learning new things.

My marathon pr as of May 30th, 2024 is 4:05:00 which I ran at TMM 2024 and the next marathon I plan on running is the 2024 Wipro Bengaluru Marathon which I'm currently training for.

Catch my training progress on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/62506000).

I love listening to music, some of my favorite artists and bands including Joji, Cage the Elephant, The Backseat Lovers, and The Beatles.

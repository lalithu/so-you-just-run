# About Me

Welcome to soyoujustrun! I'm Lalith Uriti, an undergraduate of mechanical engineering at the Manipal Institute of Technology. My passion for engineering stems from a deep desire to comprehend the mechanisms that drive our world and an insatiable curiosity for uncovering the science and physics behind them.

# My Interests

I love running, development, listening to music, and learning new things.

My marathon [PR](https://www.sportstimingsolutions.in/share.php?event_id=78282&bib=9513)(Personal Record) as of May 30th, 2024 is `04:05:47` which I set at the 2024 TATA Mumbai Marathon in January. I'm currently training for my next event, the 2024 Bengaluru Marathon by Wipro typically held during the first weekend of October.

I love listening to music while running, some of my favorite artists and bands are Joji, Cage the Elephant, The Backseat Lovers, and The Beatles.
